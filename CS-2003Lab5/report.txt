Umple is a very robust modeling language that allows the 
user to generate readable UML for easy readability and
comes with the ability to generate programming language 
specific code to ease the development process.  The plugin 
is useful for early development of classes to generate
them correctly and quickly.  It grants easy associations 
between classes making it a great tool for psuedocode
at the beginning of a project to be generated into the
first version of your code.

if I was able to write methods in umple i could 
theoretically write an entire program just using umple and
its code generation which would be an interesting challenge
